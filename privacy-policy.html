  <main>
    <p><strong>KU Soccer Training</strong> (“we”, “our”, or “the App”) helps players organize and access training exercises. This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account information:</strong> When you sign in, we collect your email address via Firebase Authentication. Your display name may also be stored if provided.</li>
      <li><strong>Training content you create:</strong> Workouts, exercises, and related notes you save in the App.</li>
      <li><strong>Basic technical data:</strong> As part of operating our services, our providers may receive standard logs such as device type, app version, and timestamps.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide sign-in and keep your account secure.</li>
      <li>Store your workouts and allow you to access them across devices.</li>
      <li>Maintain and improve the App’s reliability and features.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information. We use trusted service providers solely to operate the App, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google Firebase</strong> (Authentication, Database, and Storage) to manage login, store workout data, and host content.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Service providers process data on our behalf and under appropriate safeguards.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your information while your account is active. If you delete your account, associated data will be permanently deleted or anonymized, subject to any legal obligations.</p>

    <h2>Account Deletion</h2>
    <p>The App includes a <strong>Delete Account</strong> option in the settings menu. When you use this feature:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your account and all associated data (including workouts, saved exercises, and personal details) will be permanently deleted from our systems.</li>
      <li>The deletion is completed immediately and cannot be undone.</li>
      <li>We do not require you to contact customer service or visit an external website to finalize deletion.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you prefer, you may also request deletion by contacting us at <a href="mailto:samantha.adorno30@gmail.com">samantha.adorno30@gmail.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable administrative and technical measures to protect your information. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access/Update:</strong> You can update certain account details from within the App.</li>
      <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can permanently delete your account at any time using the in-app Delete Account button in Settings or by contacting us.</li>
      <li><strong>Consent:</strong> You may revoke permissions (such as email or Firebase login) at any time through your device settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Emails:</strong> We may send essential service emails (e.g., account or security notices).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed to children under 13. If we learn we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will delete it.</p>

    <h2>International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Your information may be stored and processed in the United States or other countries where our service providers operate.</p>

    <h2>Compliance</h2>
    <p>We comply with applicable privacy laws and Apple App Store Review (ASR & NR) requirements, including Section 5.1.1 on data collection, storage, and deletion. We minimize data collection, only request permissions relevant to core functionality, and provide users with clear ways to withdraw consent or delete their data.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date reflects the most recent changes.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions or would like to make a request, contact: <a href="mailto:samantha.adorno30@gmail.com">samantha.adorno30@gmail.com</a>.</p>
